Library Friend Michael L. VanBlaricum, also an Illinois alumnus, was invited to curate a multi-venue exhibition.  Not surprising, as VanBlaricum has amassed perhaps one of the finest collections of Ian Fleming material in private hands.  He is also President of The Ian Fleming Foundation, dedicated to the study and preservation of the history of Fleming's literary works, the James Bond phenomenon, and their impact on popular culture. Many film scholars have suggested that John Barry’s early Bond orchestrations established an entirely new music genre to portray the excitement and intrigue associated with the spy thrillers of the 1960s.  However, the syncopated guitar riff that begins the “James Bond” music theme that was first introduced in 1962 for Dr. No, and the rich orchestral cadence of the infamous “007” tune that was launched in From Russia with Love in 1963 have remained the two quintessential melodies associated with all of the Bond movie sequels that followed from 1964 through 2012. Such prominent composers and performers as Paul McCartney, Burt Bacharach, Marvin Hamlisch, Monty Norman, Duran Duran, Carly Simon, Nancy Sinatra, Shirley Bassey, and Herb Alpert and the Tijuana Brass have followed in Barry’s artistic footsteps, but none have surpassed his influence on the musical portrayal of Britain’s most recognized super spy. This exhibit explores the historical and musical roots of these two distinct movie themes and illustrates through music, photographs, graphic art, and oral history interviews their lasting impact on the Bond movie legacy.  Open Monday, Tuesday, Thursday, Friday 8:30-12:00 and 1:00-5:00.  Special hours on April 13 from 1:00-3:00.

Sixth Street, Champaign Cost No cost Sponsor Sousa Archives and Center for American Music Contact Scott Schwartz E-Mail schwrtzs@illinois.edu Phone 333-4577 Event type Exhibit Views 5304 Originating Calendar Library Calendar Victor August Herbert (1859-1924) was an American composer, cellist, and conductor who is most frequently remembered for his popular Broadway operettas Babes in Toyland (1903) and Naughty Marietta (1910) and the founder of the American Society of Composers, Authors, and Publishers (ASCAP) in 1914. ASCAP protected the copyrights of compositions of its members which initially included Irving Berlin, Otto Harbach, James Weldon Johnson, Jerome Kern, and John Philip Sousa. When Herbert died in 1924 his extensive library of original and published music, which included works by Herbert and many other famous composers, was auctioned off for a fraction of its value. Sousa remarked in the article, “Sousa Will Leave His Immense Music Collection to Public Libraries” that appeared in Nashville’s Tennessean on July 26, 1924, “It was announced that… a bundle of scores of comic operas by Herbert went for $32. I can’t believe those were autographs of Herbert’s own compositions. The autograph original of the score of one of Victor Herbert’s operas ought to command a figure of at least $1,000.” This exhibit investigates how Sousa’s extensive library of original and published music came to the University of Illinois in 1932 and its continuing impact on today’s research and performance of early American wind band music.

Sixth Street, Champaign Cost No cost Sponsor Sousa Archives and Center for American Music Contact Scott Schwartz E-Mail schwrtzs@illinois.edu Phone 333-4577 Event type Exhibit Views 5251 Originating Calendar Library Calendar Like most musicians and music ensembles that toured throughout the United States at the end of the nineteenth and early twentieth centuries, the Sousa Band traveled over 1,272,000 miles by railroad. Before the age of the inexpensive automobiles and the development of America’s interstate road system, reliable and efficient long-distance transportation between cities and states was only possible by rail. Train travel also had its downside which often included delays brought about by mechanical failures and accidents associated with collisions, derailments, locomotive boiler explosions, and bridge collapses. When Otto Mesloh performed with the Sousa Band between 1898 and 1899 he travelled extensively throughout the Northeast and Midwest, and his rail experiences were always positive. After leaving the band in 1899 Mesloh took a position as the lead cornetist with the Elite Musical Four and travelled extensively by train to perform numerous concerts in New York City, Philadelphia, and Atlantic City. This exhibit briefly highlights Otto Mesloh’s career with the John Philip Sousa Band and the Elite Musical Four, and graphically describes the 1906 train wreck that nearly took his life.

During America’s roaring 1920s the allure of traveling to new exotic destinations by automobile on the country’s developing byways had captured the imagination of many urban adventurers, like the Strothkamp family, who sought escape from the forests of brick and concrete that surrounded their city-dwelling lives. Charles’ black and white travel photographs colorfully portray the exploits of his family’s many road trips through America.

Sixth Street, Champaign Cost No cost Sponsor Sousa Archives and Center for American Music Contact Scott Schwartz E-Mail schwrtzs@illinois.edu Phone 333-4577 Event type Exhibit Views 5030 Originating Calendar Library Calendar The University of Illinois, founded in 1867 as one of the country’s first Land Grant Colleges, was the first of its kind to establish a regimental band in 1868. The University’s band program during the early twentieth century became the model for all other collegiate bands across America. Serving as Illinois’ first band director (1908-1948), A. Austin Harding played a major role in the development of special educational and performance band clinics, and for his tireless work earned the reputation of being the dean of America’s school band movement. Mark Hindsley, as Illinois’ second band director (1948-1970), became the commander of orchestral transcription practice for bands with his arrangements of Rimsky Korsakov’s Sheherazade, Liszt’s Preludes, and Richard Wagner’s Die Meistersinger, and his works remained the standards of America’s band repertoire for decades. Harry Begian was the captain of one of the country’s first collegiate band conducting internship programs at the University of Illinois (1970-1984) which helped better prepare future band conductors, and his efforts became a model for other band conducting programs. James F. Keene as Illinois' fourth band director between 1985 and 2008 founded Illinois' unique commissioning initiative which sought out new music compositions for wind ensembles that continue to influence American band performance. This exhibit explores the special historical legacies of Illinois’ first four band directors and their influence on America’s band directors that followed in their footsteps.

He was a strong supporter of Theodore Roosevelt’s New Deal policies and often described himself as a “left-libertarian.” He earned his Master of Library Science degree from the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign in 1960 and a Ph.D. in folklore from the University of Pennsylvania in 1968. He joined the Illinois faculty in 1960 with a joint appointment in the Institute of Labor and Industrial Relations and the English Department. In the spring of 1961 the Campus Folksong Club (CFC) was organized by Dick Kanar and Vic Lukas with Green serving as the organization’s faculty advisor. Green wrote in the CFC’s first newsletter, Autoharp, which was issued on April 7, 1961, “If traditional folksong is to be heard on campus, other than via record and tape, it must be heard by importing true folksingers or by imparting to collegiate singers of folksong some respect for traditional material and styles.” This exhibit explores through photographs, music and oral history the remarkable story of the CFC and folklore studies on the Illinois campus between 1961 and 1970.

General Events General Events The campus calendar displays events of both campus and community interest. Archie Green and the Campus Folksong Club Archie Green was one of America’s leading twentieth-century folklorists who specialized in labor lore history and folk music traditions. He was a strong supporter of Theodore Roosevelt’s New Deal policies and often described himself as a “left-libertarian.” He earned his Master of Library Science degree from the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign in 1960 and a Ph.D. in folklore from the University of Pennsylvania in 1968. He joined the Illinois faculty in 1960 with a joint appointment in the Institute of Labor and Industrial Relations and the English Department. In the spring of 1961 the Campus Folksong Club (CFC) was organized by Dick Kanar and Vic Lukas with Green serving as the organization’s faculty advisor. Green wrote in the CFC’s first newsletter, Autoharp, which was issued on April 7, 1961, “If traditional folksong is to be heard on campus, other than via record and tape, it must be heard by importing true folksingers or by imparting to collegiate singers of folksong some respect for traditional material and styles.” This exhibit explores through photographs, music and oral history the remarkable story of the CFC and folklore studies on the Illinois campus between 1961 and 1970. "Switch" screening with discussion led by Dr. Scott W. Tinker What does the future of energy really hold? Join energy visionary Dr. Scott Tinker on a spectacular global adventure to find out. Dr. Tinker explores the world’s leading energy sites, from coal to solar, oil to biofuels, many highly restricted and never before seen on film. He gets straight answers from the people driving energy today, international leaders of government, industry and academia. In the end, he cuts through the confusion to discover a path to our future that is surprising and remarkably pragmatic. Switch is the first truly balanced energy film, embraced and supported by people all along the energy spectrum – fossil and renewable, academic and environmental. View the trailer here: http://vimeo.com/40489581Scott Tinker is the Director of the Bureau of Economic Geology and the State Geologist of Texas. He is also the acting Associate Dean for Research, and a Professor holding the Allday Endowed Chair in the Jackson School of Geosciences at The University of Texas at Austin. He is an internationally known energy expert, giving invited lectures more than 40 times a year to industry, government, and academic groups, striving to bring them together in a common understanding of energy.  Big Data Summit To address the challenges of moving from the Buzz to the Biz of Big Data the University of Illinois Research Park (UIRP) would like to invite you to Big Data Summit 2013. The Big Data Summit will bring together thought leaders from the UIRP, industry, and academia for a highly interactive event to address topics surrounding big data. Just as new information technologies and the Internet itself fundamentally transformed business and industrial competitiveness over the past 25 years, big data is posed to bring the next wave of innovation, productivity, and growth. The coupling of big data and advanced analytics has the potential to raise the efficiency and create value in almost all business sectors. Exploiting big data and advanced analytics enables companies to create new products and services, enhance existing ones, and invent entirely new business, models. Annual Carol Concert An exuberant tradition returns when choruses, instrumentalists, and audience members join in a celebration of the winter season.
